# LeaFlet challenge
___


* This code creates an ***[interactive map](file:///C:/Users/mssab/OneDrive/Desktop/BOOTCAMP/15-Mapping/leaflet-challenge/index.html)*** using **Leaflet** to visualize recent earthquake data. The map centers on the Colorado-Nebraska border and uses a custom tile layer for a clear view of state and country borders.

* GeoJSON data of recent earthquakes is loaded with **D3.js**, and each earthquake is represented by a circle marker. The marker's color indicates depth (green for shallow, red for deep), and its size reflects the magnitude. ***Clicking on a marker reveals detailed information about the earthquake.***

* **A legend is added to explain the color coding**, with each depth range clearly labeled. The legend is styled with a white background to ensure clarity.
